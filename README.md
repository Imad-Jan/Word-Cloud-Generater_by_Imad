Problem Statement
While AI shows promise to enhance healthcare delivery, its widespread
adoption in UAE's healthcare system faces certain challenges. As per the
study of Bani Issa et al. (2020), The lack of concise guidelines of data privacy
and security raises concerns about the protection of sensitive patient
information.
Additionally, the The healthcare workforce in the UAE lacks the necessary
training and expertise to effectively utilize AI technologies (Al Badi et al. 2020).
The study of Dicuonzo et al. (20230 reveals that Deploying advanced AI systems
can be expensive,especially in health care sectors because of their high
processing power which results making it difficult for adapting AI based
technologies for healthcare providers.
Moreover , Cultural aspects can also impact how patients and healthcare
providers accept and utilize AI in healthcare sector.
To make AI work in UAE healthcare, the UAE must protect patient privacy by
Develop and implement clear data privacy and security guidelines. Provide
education and training to workers to utlize ai in effectively manner, propose budget
friendly finance program to make ai affordable for healthcare sector , and address
cultural concerns by Conducting public awareness campaigns using different
mediums to promote acceptance of AI.
Research Significance:
As the UAE strives to be a top-notch medical center using high-tech solutions,
it's crucial to overcome obstacles hindering the responsible use of AI in
healthcare. This will make it easier to blend AI into medical and operational to
tasks, [6]. Research in this domain can help develop evidence-based
implementation frameworks aligned with national priorities as well as global
standards on oversight, safety and privacy [7]. Such work will facilitate
mainstreaming of emerging technologies to serve social goals of enhanced
outcomes, access and efficiency [8].
Research Aim
This research aims to explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is influencing the
transformation of healthcare in the UAE. We'll be looking into how AI is
currently being used, how prepared the healthcare system is for adopting AI,
and what policies are in place to govern these technologies
Research Questions
This study seeks to answer the following research questions:
1. RQ1: What are the main AI solutions currently in use within healthcare
settings in the UAE, and what does the existing literature say about
their impact?
2. RQ2: What factors play a role in the widespread adoption of AI
throughout the healthcare system in the UAE? Or **RQ2:** What
makes it easy or hard for many parts of the healthcare system in the
UAE to use AI?
3. RQ3: Which guidelines and frameworks can support the safe,
standardized, and beneficial integration of AI on a national scale in line
with global best practices?
Research Objectives
The specific objectives of this study are to:
1. Objective 1: Analyze the impact of AI applications used in the UAE
healthcare system through case studies and literature review.
2. Objective 2: Identify barriers and opportunities for AI integration through
stakeholder interviews.
3. Objective 3: Propose guidelines, frameworks, and standards for AI
integration in the UAE healthcare system based on international
benchmarks.
4. Objective 4: Recommend strategies for accelerating responsible
adoption of AI in the UAE healthcare system.
Research Outline
The study will follow a comprehensive research methodology that includes:
1. Literature review on AI in healthcare: A thorough review of relevant
literature will be conducted to understand the current state of AI in
healthcare, its applications, and the challenges and opportunities
associated with its adoption.
2. Case studies: Case studies will be conducted to analyze the impact of
specific AI applications in the UAE healthcare system.
3. Expert interviews: Interviews with key stakeholders in the UAE
healthcare sector will be conducted to gain insights into the barriers and opportunities for AI integration.
4. Policy analysis: A comprehensive analysis of current and emerging AI
policies in the UAE and other countries will be conducted.
5. Framework development: Based on the findings of the literature review,
case studies, expert interviews, and policy analysis, a framework for
responsible AI integration in the UAE healthcare system will be
developed.
6. Recommendations: Specific recommendations for accelerating the
adoption of AI in the UAE healthcare system will be provided.
Conclusion
This study aims to provide valuable insights into the adoption of AI in the
UAE's healthcare system, contributing to the development of evidence-based
strategies for responsible and effective AI integration. By addressing the
challenges and leveraging the opportunities presented by AI, the UAE can
establish itself as a leader in healthcare innovation, improving patient
outcomes, enhancing access to care, and driving efficiency.
